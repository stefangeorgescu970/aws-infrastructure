# The `stacks` Directory
This directory contains Terraform modules which help deploy simple blocks of infrastructure, such as a Lambda Function and it's required IAM role, or an S3 bucket with an associated Public Access Block.

You can consider those simpler, adapted to my own use case implementations compared with the ones found on the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io).
