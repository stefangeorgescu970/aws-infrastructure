# The `live` directory
This directory contains definitions for all the AWS accounts I use, which are the three: development (dev), staging (stg) and production (prod).

Each of these subdirectories contain the definition of the infrastructure blocks deployed in each of them. They also represent the place where the terraform commands must be ran.
